## Election Audit Summary
The advantage for refactoring code is that we can access the data we want in a faster time. The disadvantages might be refactoring code is very time consuming.
## How do these pros and cons apply to refactoring the original VBA script?
We need to make sure that the code we produced in the end is clear and there is no mistake in any of the steps, because a single mistake might cause the entire code unable to run. Also, if the project we need to finish is in a tight time frame, we might also need to reconsider using VBA because it is a bit time consuming.
