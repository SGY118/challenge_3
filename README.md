## Election Audit Summary
If we changed a bit of the output names of the scripts, then we can use it in different kinds of elections.
For example, if we are in a school and we want to raise a student president, we can change the county names into student names and county votes and change to student votes according to grades. Moreover, we can also use this script for voting the actor with the best performance in a show. We then can change the county names into actors names and county votes to audience votes.
